<p> The nucleus of radioactive atoms emits high-energy
electromagnetic radiation, known as gamma radiation. Because
of its penetrating power and capacity to destroy hazardous
bacteria, it is used for a variety of applications, such as medical
imaging (such as PET scans), industrial applications (such as
material testing), and sterilizing. Real-time gamma radiation
monitoring is crucial for safety in nuclear facilities and
environmental protection, as it allows for immediate detection
and response to potential radiation hazards. This research
paper covers many issues, such as radiation monitoring, gamma
spectroscopy and FPGA-based radiation detection systems.
They propose novel approaches and techniques for solving
problems using information on radioactivity and radioactive
decay processes. Specifically, newer gamma-ray detectors with
different target crystals, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) along
with the latest data-acquisition systems can be developed to have
better energy resolution for proper radiation measurement
leading to more effective therapies in medical radiation therapy
In addition, the papers highlight advantages of this digital signal
processing using FPGA for more informative data analysis; high
resolution measurements are possible there as well as pulse
discrimination in nuclear spectroscopy. The study reviews SET
analysis in SRAM-based FPGAs for space applications as well
as the effects of integrated digitizers on energy resolution and
differentiation of pulse shapes. This leads to development in the
area of radiation detection and spectroscopy resulting in new
opportunities for a better radiation monitoring and data
interpretation within nuclear physics, chemical, biological and
medical fields. </p>

<h1 style = “font-size:50px;”> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p> Humans have always been fascinated by radiation in
various forms-be it particles carrying energy or
electromagnetic waves. Of all these types of radiation, gamma
is most important due to the capacity to penetrate making it a
useful tool but also a safety concern. In addition, it analyzes
the possibility of using this technology in health and
environment purposes.<br>
The emission and transfer of energy in the form of
electromagnetic waves or particles is referred to as
"Radiation". Gamma radiation being the type amongst many
other types of radiations is a very energetic electromagnetic
wave which makes it important to both nuclear physics and
radiology.<br>
The emission of gamma rays is mainly derived as a result
of nuclear processes in which atomic nuclei undergo changes.
Gamma radiation can be emitted into the environment from
radioactive decay of some elements, nuclear reactions, or
particles with high energies interacting with matter. These
processes usually result in the emission of high-energy
photon.<br>
Gamma rays are very penetrating, therefore they are useful
yet dangerous. These people work with X-rays and other
forms of radiation for diagnosing and curing ailments like
cancer in medical imaging and radiation therapy.<br> This is true as prolonged exposure to gamma radiation leads to severe
health issues such as radiation sickness with a higher
probability of cancer. Thus, comprehending and governing
gamma rays are essential to many uses.<br>
FPGAs are field-programmable circuit arrays that enable
users to program in their own digital circuit logic. Such
versatile hardware devices have unique advantages as they are
programmable and can be customized specifically for a
particular task. The combination of flexibility and high
processing power allows FPGAs to be effective instrument in
many disciplines like engineering, science, etc.<br>
Signal processing and data analysis can be performed
effectively with FPGAs in gamma spectroscopy. Such realtime spectral analyses are performed using their high speed
parallel data processing abilities. The use of advanced pulse
shaping, energy calibration, peak identification algorithms is
important in gamma spectroscopy research.<br> In addition, the
flexibility of FPGAs ensures that it can be adapted to various
experimental configurations as well as data processing needs.<br>
The energy between gamma spectroscopy and FPGAs has
not only opened doors for advancements within their
respective fields but has also fostered interdisciplinary
collaborations. Scientists, engineers, and medical
professionals are increasingly working together to leverage
this technology for various applications.<br> This collaboration is
leading to innovative solutions that were previously
unthinkable. For instance, the combination of gamma
spectroscopy and FPGAs has the potential to revolutionize not
only the fields of radiation monitoring and medical imaging
but also areas like materials science, security, and space
exploration. As we continue to explore the possibilities, we
may discover new ways to harness the power of gamma
radiation, further enhancing our understanding of the universe
and our ability to address complex challenges.<br>
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have emerged
as a powerful tool in gamma spectroscopy, effectively
addressing the critical challenges of enhanced detector
resolution and sensitivity. FPGAs' inherent flexibility and
parallel processing capabilities facilitate the implementation
of advanced pulse shaping and energy calibration algorithms,
significantly improving the quality of gamma spectroscopy
data. With continuous advancements in FPGA technology,
researchers are actively exploring their potential to develop
even more efficient and accurate processing methods, further
propelling the frontiers of gamma spectroscopy.<b>
The integration of FPGAs into gamma spectroscopy has
revolutionized the field, bringing about significant
advancements in real-time processing capabilities. With
ongoing improvements in FPGA technology, we can expect
even faster and more adaptable systems, leading to
breakthroughs in environmental monitoring, nuclear security,
medical diagnostics, and more. The use of FPGA-based
procedures in real-time gamma spectroscopy will continue to
play a pivotal role in ensuring public safety, efficiency, and
well-being.<br>
